## About Me

I am a lecturer and researcher focusing on the design and development of intelligent academic information systems, decision support systems, and applied software engineering solutions for higher education.

My work integrates:
- Constraint-based modeling
- Scheduling optimization
- Workload fairness analysis
- Academic system automation
- Virtual and cloud-based laboratory systems

I am particularly interested in transforming real institutional problems into structured computational models with measurable performance improvements.

Constraint-based and fairness-aware seminar scheduling model with experimental evaluation.

Focus:
- Conflict minimization
- Workload variance reduction
- Performance benchmarking

### 2. Academic Workload Optimization Model
Mathematical modeling and simulation of lecturer workload balancing strategies.

Focus:
- Fairness metrics (variance, standard deviation, distribution index)
- Comparative algorithm analysis
- Scalability evaluation

### 3. Virtual Laboratory Architecture Framework
Design and implementation of scalable virtual lab environments for software engineering education.

Focus:
- Resource allocation modeling
- Cloud-based deployment
- Infrastructure efficiency

## Research Methodology Approach

My development workflow integrates:

1. Problem formalization  
2. Constraint modeling  
3. Algorithm implementation  
4. Experimental validation  
5. Quantitative performance evaluation  
6. Reproducible research documentation  

GitHub repositories serve as structured research laboratories, where experiments, logs, and results are version-controlled and systematically documented.
